# Predictive Analysis of Higher Education Enrollment Trends

## Project Overview:
This project delves into the intricate landscape of student participation and course preferences within our local University. From comprehensive data analysis to predictive modeling, we embark on a journey to extract meaningful insights and develop models that inform strategic decisions.

## Tasks:

### Task 1: Data Understanding and Preprocessing
- Evaluate each dataset column against predefined descriptions.
- Identify and address missing values.
- Document steps taken to align values with descriptions.

### Task 2: Distribution of Enrollment Counts
- Explore enrollment count distribution through insightful visualizations.

### Task 3: Visualization of Course Types
- Create visualizations showcasing the distribution of course types.
- Identify the course type with the highest frequency.
- Evaluate balance across different course types.

### Task 4: Relationship between Course Type and Enrollment
- Analyze the connection between course type and enrollment counts using visualizations.

### Task 5: Predictive Modeling - Type of Machine Learning Problem
- Determine the nature of the predictive task (regression) for estimating student enrollments.

### Task 6: Baseline Model for Enrollment Prediction
- Develop and fit a baseline model for predicting student enrollments.
- Share code implementing the baseline model.

### Task 7: Comparison Model for Enrollment Prediction
- Create a comparison model using a different approach.
- Share code for the comparison model.

### Task 8: Model Selection Rationale
- Explain the rationale behind selecting baseline and comparison models.

### Task 9: Model Performance Comparison
- Compare the performance of baseline and comparison models.
- Share code for performance evaluation.

### Task 10: Model Performance Analysis
- Elucidate which model outperforms the other based on the performance comparison.

## Project Outcome:
This project aims to unravel higher education enrollment trends, providing actionable insights and predictive capabilities. Our data-driven journey illuminates the path forward, empowering the University to make informed decisions for a more enriching learning experience. Join us on this exploration into the dynamic world of higher education.
